README file for Star.P.G.
=============================

This is Star.P.G., a free/open source computer game.

About
-----
An arcade style, side scrolling shooter.

It was just supposed to be a one month game project...now its almost a year in the making. :P
Star.P.G. is a personal project, I never intended or for that matter wish for help on the code for this game. 
For me it is an enjoyable experience writing the code and learning from it.
If you are interested in modifying the code, you are welcome to fork my game and make a derivative from it. (I think after V1.0 I will be open to contributions)
I only placed Star.P.G. on the Internet in order to utilize the benefits of version control systems, and also in the unlikely event that it may be of use or interest to someone.
I am not looking for help or contributions to the code. 
Although if you are an artist or musician, and wish to improve the games resources, I would be happy to include them and give due credit.

Known bugs
----------
As this is still a work in progress, the format of the savegames may, and does change quite often.
It is recommended you either overwrite your older savegames with new ones, or delete the older ones when upgrading to a newer version of Star.P.G..
Or better still remove the older version of the game completely, before installing a newer version.
If the game fails to load, try deleting the Star.P.G..cfg file, it may be caused by recent improvements to the game.

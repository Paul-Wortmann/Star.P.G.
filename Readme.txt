Star.P.G.
---------

An arcade style, side scrolling shooter.

During the development of this game, I am have learned a lot of lessons of how not to make games, so the code is not very neat and organized.
I only placed Star.P.G. on the Internet in order to utilize the benefits of version control systems, and also in the unlikely event that it may be of use or interest to someone.
I am not looking for help or contributions in the games development, but feel free to copy it and make your own game from it if you like.

Savegames:
----------

As this is still a work in progress, the format of the savegames may,
and does change quite often.
It is recomended you either overwrite your older savegames with new ones, 
or delete the older ones when upgrading to a newer version of Star.P.G..
Or better still remove the older version of the game completely, before installing a newer version.

| About |
---------

An arcade style, side scrolling shooter.

It was just supposed to be a one month game project...now its almost a year in the making. :P
I think I wrote most of the initial code rather hastily, and as such there are places in the code that could do with improvement.
As I add features and improve the game, I have been slowly re-writing most if it as I go.
Star.P.G. is a personal project, and as such there are no comments in the code base as only I am working on the code and don't require them.
I think the newer sections of the code are pretty easy to read and self explanatory, I also use an easy to ready naming convention.
I never intended or for that matter wish for help on the code for this game. For me it is an enjoyable experience writing the code and learning from it.
If you are interested in modifying the code, you are welcome to fork my game and make a derivative from it.
I only placed Star.P.G. on the Internet in order to utilize the benefits of version control systems, and also in the unlikely event that it may be of use or interest to someone.
I am not looking for help or contributions to the code.
Although if you are an artist or musician, and wish to improve the games resources, I would be happy to include them and give due credit.

| Savegames: |
--------------

As this is still a work in progress, the format of the savegames may, and does change quite often.
It is recommended you either overwrite your older savegames with new ones, or delete the older ones when upgrading to a newer version of Star.P.G..
Or better still remove the older version of the game completely, before installing a newer version.
If the game fails to load, try deleting / modifying the Star.P.G..cfg file, it may be caused by recent improvements to the game.

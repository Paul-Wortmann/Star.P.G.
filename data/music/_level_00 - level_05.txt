-=/fx 2.0/=-
a nes chiptune disk by virt
-----------------

it has been about two years since fx was released, and i've been introduced to a
pretty active chiptune scene through it. there are a lot of really awesome
people who are into this stuff.

a student of film composition might, as part of his studies, practice re-scoring
a whole film. that is, he cuts out the existing music track, and writes his own
to replace it. i needed to go beyond the vaguely konami-style tunes of fx, and
actually pretend that i had been hired to compose for specific konami nes games.

so, here are 6 new tunes. they are in the genre/style of music from the original
games, with my own style added and, in some cases, a lot of progressive metal
influences. i got the baroque-ish castlevania-esque stuff out of my system last
time - here i am concentrating on other games, action titles and shooters.

please either listen in impulse tracker or xmplay, or download the mp3s from my
site or wherever you got this zip. modplug and winamp butcher the tunes, ranging
from not playing at all to missing the noise channel to messed up note bends. if
you listen in a mod player the chances are good you're not hearing it correctly,
and it may sound awful.

	v-blast
		blast off (gyruss): in the game, an absolutely brilliant
		"konamization" of bach's toccata and fugue in dmin plays. this
		is what i would do instead.

	v-bogey
		bogey at your 6 (top gun): a much more aggressive and frantic
		tune than the original, with guitar solos, and the original dpcm
		jet hum in the background. even trusty xmplay will mess up the
		tempo of the intro, so check out the MP3 if you can't use
		impulse tracker to listen.

	v-falcon
		vile red falcon (contra): this is the most sparse of all the
		songs, but contra is one of the sparsest konami soundtracks,
		too. i did some weird rhythmic stuff here.

	v-ptime
		pizza time (tmnt 1): starts out with my version of overworld
		music, then sort of goes off on a huge tangent and skips to
		later in the game, and inside later buildings, then bosses and
		stuff. gets really progressive-wank later on.

	v-option
		option (gradius 2): traditional konami "shooter music" - a genre
		that is completely exlusive to games, and immediately
		recognizable.

	v-shock
		shell shock (tmnt 3): tmnt3 is my favorite nes soundtrack of all
		time, and this is my attempt to pay homage to it. i love the
		"HEY!" sample so, so much.

!!!!!!!!!!! MML / MCK RULES !!!!!!!!!!!!
near the end of my work on this disk, i started to get into using mck to
actually write authentic nes music in nsf format, and i'm pretty sure that if i
release more nes music it will be as nsfs or even as a .nes demo rom! mml is a
scripting language popular in japan, used for everything from cellphones to
midi, and using a tool called mck, you can compile it with a sound driver into
working nes tunes! grab my english translation of the mck docs at
http://virt.vgmix.com/mckc-e.txt and the tools at http://nesmusic.zophar.net and
get started making your own REAL nes music!
